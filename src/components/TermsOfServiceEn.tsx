                          <p className="mt-4">As the company using content licensed through 82DASH platform, you are responsible for handling any revocation of consent or data subject rights requests related to the content you have received and processed, when you act as the data controller after content transfer.</p>
                          <p className="mt-4">If a creator revokes their consent under applicable data protection laws (such as the GDPR or CCPA), and their identity is visible in the licensed content, 82DASH will notify you promptly. Upon receiving such notice, you are required to:</p>

                          <p className="mt-4">The licence granted through 82DASH is generally irrevocable for commercial use in terms of intellectual property rights. However, if the content contains identifiable personal data, your obligations under applicable privacy and data protection laws (such as the GDPR or CCPA) may take precedence. </p>
                          <p className="mt-4">In such cases, individuals may exercise their legal rights such as withdrawal of consent, erasure requests, or objections to further processing which may require you to cease use of the affected content and delete any associated copies.</p>
                          <p className="mt-4">Such requests must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. If no other lawful basis (e.g. contractual necessity, legal obligation, or legitimate interest) justifies continued use, the privacy rights of the individual override the licence. 82DASH will promptly notify you of any revocation or withdrawal requests it receives, but once the content is transferred, you assume the role of data controller and are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws.</p>
                          <p className="mt-4">Failure to comply with a valid revocation or data subject request may result in legal liability and may constitute a material breach of your agreement with 82DASH. 82DASH shall not be held liable for any such non-compliance by the licensee.</p>

                      <p className="mt-4">The purpose of this license is to ensure transparency, fairness, and a clear understanding between creators and business users. It defines the scope of the rights granted and outlines the responsibilities of both parties. The specific terms of this agreement are detailed in the following sections.</p>

                          <p className="mt-4">However, by uploading content in response to a specific request and confirming agreement during submission, the Creator grants the company that initiated the request (“the Requesting Company”) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, and worldwide licence to use the content under the following terms:</p>

                            <li>Utilise the content across any media or format, including but not limited to: social media, websites, online and offline advertisements, mobile apps, printed materials, email marketing, and in-store displays.</li>
                            <li>Sublicensing to third parties is not permitted unless expressly authorised through a separate agreement between 82DASH and the Requesting Company. Any such sublicensing must be confirmed in advance, and will be communicated to the creator.</li>
